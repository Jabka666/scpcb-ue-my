Desc2 = When SCP-035 is placed on the face of an individual, an alternate brain wave pattern from SCP-035 overlaps that of the original host, effectively snuffing it out and causing brain death to the subject. Subject then claims to be the consciousness contained within SCP-035.
Desc3 = Psychological analysis has discovered SCP-035 to possess a highly manipulative nature, capable of forcing sudden and profound changes to interviewer's psychological state. SCP-035 has proven to be highly sadistic, prompting some to commit suicide with linguistic persuasion alone.

Desc2 = SCP-106 causes a “corrosion” effect in all solid matter it touches, engaging a physical breakdown in materials several seconds after contact. This is observed as rusting, rotting, and cracking of materials, and the creation of a black, mucus-like substance similar to the material coating SCP-106.
Desc3 = SCP-106 can pass through solid matter and will capture and kill its prey by pulling it into what is assumed to be its personal ''pocket dimension''.

Desc1 = SCP-178 is a pair of white stereoscopic (''3-D'') glasses with a rectangular white cardboard frame and lenses of transparent blue and red (left and right lenses, respectively) plastic. The item exhibits no unusual physical properties apart from a slight discoloration of the cardboard consistent with age.
Desc2 = When worn, the wearer begins perceiving large bipedal entities in addition to its ordinary surroundings. Entities reportedly exhibit a docile and occasionally curious behavior, with one exception.

Align X = Center
Align Y = Center
DisableBackground = True
Desc1 = The practical effect of this is when a subject drinks SCP-207-1, they will effectively no longer require sleep or rest, nor attempt to sleep or rest. This effect is not lessened by any soporific or medication yet tested on test subjects.
Desc2 = In addition to removing the need for rest, SCP-207-1 also causes an increase in motor, reaction, and psychological functions. The increase is linear in progression, with an estimated 50% increase (measured by standard medical protocols, +/-5%) every 6 hours.
Desc3 = However, SCP-207-1 does not alter the body of affected subjects.

[SCP-215]
ImgPath = 215
Align X = Right
Align Y = Top
DisableBackground = True
Desc1 = When worn, SCP-215 induces a belief in the wearer that inanimate objects are sentient and capable of communication with the wearer. The severity of this delusion varies from wearer to wearer, but generally strengthens over time if SCP-215 is worn regularly, and in the worst cases manifests as a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, culminating in an irrational fear of all machines.
Desc2 = There is no definite "safe" amount of time to wear SCP-215; while the onset of delusions generally takes at least twenty-four (24) hours, a great deal depends on the psychological disposition of the wearer before SCP-215 is put on, and persons who already have some varieties of obsessive-compulsive, synesthesiac, or technophiliac disorders have been known to begin suffering SCP-215's effects less than an hour after donning it.
Desc3 = Removing SCP-215 does not remove the delusion, although normal methods of therapy have proven to be effective in less severe cases so long as SCP-215 is not put on again; a full recovery can turn to a full relapse in less than a day by the return of SCP-215. By the end of the second week, wearers tend to violently resist any attempt to separate them from SCP-215.

Desc2 = SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of SCP-500 in the Input booth of SCP-914 and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to biological tissue, it rapidly regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections.
Desc3 = However, long-term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body's natural systems. Class-D personnel exposed to the device for over an hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue.
Desc4 = The "Flesh Beasts" created by SCP-427 are incredibly aggressive, attacking any and all personnel on sight with lethal results. They are highly resistant to most known weaponry.

Align X = Center
Align Y = Center
DisableBackground = True

Desc2 = SCP-939's primary method of luring prey is the imitation of human speech in the voices of prior victims, though imitation of other species and active nocturnal hunts have been documented.
Desc3 = Prey is usually killed with a single bite to the cranium or neck; bite forces have been measured in excess of 35 MPa.

[SCP-966]
ImgPath = 966
Align X = Left
Align Y = Bottom
DisableBackground = True
Desc1 = SCP-966 are visible only at wavelengths ranging from 700 nm to about 900 nm. This applies to all of SCP-966's tissues, regardless of their current state.
Desc2 = Their hunting methods consist on emitting a single burst of a previously unknown type of wave, which permanently inhibits the ability of the affected creature to enter in any of the NREM and REM sleep stages. The ability to micro sleep is also lost.
Desc3 = After depriving their victims of sleep, SCP-966 will stalk their prey until the lack of rest incapacitates it. At this point, SCP-966 will proceed to consume it.

DisableBackground = True
Desc1 = When worn, it launches 12 (twelve) ultrathin probes into the body of the carrier (they were only found during the examination of the body of the carrier with [DATA REDACTED]), which penetrate into different parts of the body. The wearer at the same time experiences only a slight burning of the skin under the bracelet, which quickly passes.
Desc2 = For each action that protects the carrier, the object takes away some of its blood, depending on the level of threat. Complete bleeding is possible, the user dies while the SCP-1033 separates from it.If the carrier removes the object itself, then for a while (from 2 (two) weeks to 3 (three) months) the regeneration of blood is greatly slowed, even if the protection mechanism has not been activated once.

[SCP-1048]
ImgPath = 1048
Align X = Center

Desc2 = Subject is capable of moving of its own accord, and can communicate through a small range of gestures. The subject regularly shows affection to individuals in ways found endearing by most people.
Desc3 = Affection is usually given in the form of a hug to the lower leg, but subject has also been observed dancing, jumping in place, and in two separate events it has even drawn child-like pictures for personnel.
Desc4 = SCP-1048 uses its endearing qualities to lull those around it in to a false sense of security, allowing it to collect materials to produce these creations.
