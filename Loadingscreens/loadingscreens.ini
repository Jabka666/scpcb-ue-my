text2 = SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of SCP-500 in the Input booth of SCP-914 and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to biological tissue, it rapidly regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections.
text3 = However, long-term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body's natural systems. Class-D personnel exposed to the device for over an hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue.
text4 = The "Flesh Beasts" created by SCP-427 are incredibly aggressive, attacking any and all personnel on sight with lethal results. They are highly resistant to most known weaponry.

text3 = Prey is usually killed with a single bite to the cranium or neck; bite forces have been measured in excess of 35 MPa.


[SCP-966]
image path = 966.jpg
align x = left
align y = bottom
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-966 are visible only at wavelengths ranging from 700 nm to about 900 nm. This applies to all of SCP-966's tissues, regardless of their current state.
text2 = Their hunting methods consist on emitting a single burst of a previously unknown type of wave, which permanently inhibits the ability of the affected creature to enter in any of the NREM and REM sleep stages. The ability to micro sleep is also lost.
text3 = After depriving their victims of sleep, SCP-966 will stalk their prey until the lack of rest incapacitates it. At this point, SCP-966 will proceed to consume it.

disablebackground = true 
text1 = SCP-1123 is a human skull missing the lower mandible and all its teeth. Across the exterior squama frontalis is modern Khmer script, written in human blood, that translates as "Remember".
text2 = Genetic testing confirms that both the skull and the blood are from the same individual. The Khmer script is badly faded, and invisible to most subjects beyond 5 meters distance.
text3 = Subjects at 1 meter or less from the object will report the blood being fresh, as if "still wet", as well as other anomalous sensory phenomena, including smells, sounds, and tactile responses.

[SCP-1162]

align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true 
text1 = SCP-1162 is, currently, a hole in a cinderblock wall at Site-[DATA REDACTED].
