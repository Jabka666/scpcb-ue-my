(http://undertowgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3404):
	- SCP-178, SCP-1074, SCP-1123
	- New rooms
	- Night Vision Goggles
	- Clipboard for storing documents
	- Achievement menu
- New difficulty system:
	- Safe: basically the same as the old Euclid-mode
	- Euclid: you can only save at computer- and security monitors
	- Keter: permadeath and more aggressive SCPs (higher spawnrates and some
	of them chase the player more actively instead of wandering around randomly)
	- Custom: self explanatory
- A new room in the pocket dimension (replaces the room with the floating clouds of smoke)
- Some changes to the maintenance tunnel
- The SCPs that can "teleport" from waypoint to another (such as 173) can no longer
teleport to waypoints next to the player, so 173 shouldn't pop up from nowhere anymore

- Stairs are easier to climb up now
- Some optimization to the way NPCs are animated; FPS doesn't drop as drastically when
the MTF spawn anymore (although it still does drop quite a bit due to the jumble of 
spaghetti that is supposed to be their AI)
- Minor bugfixes in the MTF AI
- Room-specific ambient sounds are re-enabled
- More optimization to the room models: 
	- the "shared prop model" system added in 1.0.6 is now implemented in all rooms

crashes caused by it on some computers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0.6
- Gamma slider in the options (unfortunately only works in fullscreen mode)
- The props in the rooms (lamps, chairs, etc) aren't included in the actual room model 
anymore, but instead share the same model. This reduces memory consumption and the 
file size of the room models. The changes aren't implemented in all of the rooms yet,
so the effect isn't very significant yet

- Improved versions of the old door sounds
- The correct sounds are now played when opening/closing the large containment doors
- Random sound clips (distant gunfire, screams etc) are played for a short period
of time after the intro

	the player closes the door behind him before moving forwards in the room

originate from the guard who's talking (instead of all of the originating from
the first guard)

v0.6
- Another exit and more endings
- Crouching and hiding mechanics
- Improved intro sequence (still a work in progress)
- Better Class D models, although they're still just placeholders
- Improved MTF AI. Now they head to the last location the player was spotted in, and 
start randomly searching for him. They'll also try to recontain SCP-106 when they
reach it's chamber.
- An injury/bloodloss system, so now it's possible (although hard) to survive being 
shot. Gunshot wounds make you bleed, and losing too much blood eventually kills you.
Injuries can be healed with first aid kits, but it takes some time (so you can't just 
start bandaging a wound while you're being shot at) and a regular first aid kit
won't heal you completely. The degree of the injuries depends on which part of your 
body got hit - headshots are still instakill.
- Type "injure [0-5]" in the console if you want to check out the injury system

- A console command for spawning items (spawnitem [the name of the item])
- An anomalous duck
- A ton of small bugfixes

- ...And a last minute addition, SCP-096. It's using a placeholder model made by
Mirocaine until we get a better one.

seconds, causing annoying twitching. Now they're loaded only the moment the MTF spawns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.5
- GATE B and multiple endings. So now it's possible to get out and BEAT THE GAME.
- Mobile Task Force groups whose job is to clear the facility of the escaped
SCPs and other potential hazards (they still need some tweaking and their AI may 
be a bit buggy at times)
- some new rooms (including the silo of the Omega Warhead)
- improved map generation algorithm:
	- it shouldn't generate maps that are impossible to get through anymore
