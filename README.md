# SCP - Containment Breach Ultimate Edition Reborn

This mod is a fork of SCP - Containment Breach, based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (http://www.scp-wiki.net/).

The main goal of the mod is to rekindle interest in SCP - Containment Breach, improve its stability, and diversify gameplay by adding new SCPs, mechanics, and updated visuals.
