[tooltip]
cantchange = This option cannot be changed in-game.
fullscreen = This option only takes effect in fullscreen.
bump = "Bump mapping" is used to simulate bumps and dents by distorting the lightmaps.
vsync = "Vertical sync" waits for the display to finish its current refresh cycle before calculating the next frame, preventing issues such as screen tearing. This ties the game's frame rate to your display's refresh rate and may cause some input lag.
alias = "Anti-Aliasing" is used to smooth the rendered image before displaying in order to reduce aliasing around the edges of models.
lights = Toggles the artificial lens flare effect generated over light sources.
gamma = "Gamma correction" is used to achieve a good brightness factor to balance out your display's gamma if the game appears either too dark or bright. Setting it too high or low can cause the graphics to look less detailed.
default.value.100 = Current value: %s% (default is 100%)
particle_1 = Determines the amount of particles that can be rendered per tick.
particle_2.1 = Only smoke emitters will produce particles.

lod = "Texture LOD Bias" affects the distance at which texture detail will change to prevent aliasing. Change this option if textures flicker or look too blurry.
vram = Textures that are stored in the Video-RAM will load faster, but this also has negative effects on the texture quality as well.
fov = "Field of view" is the amount of game view that is on display during a game.
default.value.fov = Current value: %s° (default is 60°)
anisotropic = "Anisotropic filtering" enhances the image quality of textures on surfaces that are at oblique viewing angles with respect to the camera.
atmo = Changes the atmosphere to dark or bright. The bright atmosphere is more comfortable to play in a daylight and better for making a video. In turn, the dark one is better for a night playing.
screnderinterval = "Camera render interval" changes the frequency of security camera movement on the monitors. Change this option if you have low FPS when viewing monitors.
mastervolume = Adjusts the master volume of sounds. Sliding the bar fully to the left will mute all sounds.
default.value.50 = Current value: %s% (default is 50%)
default.value.0 = Current value: %s% (default is 0%)
musicvolume = Adjusts the volume of background music. Sliding the bar fully to the left will mute all music.
soundvolume = Adjusts the volume of sound effects. Sliding the bar fully to the left will mute all environment sounds.

autorelease = "Sound auto-release" will free a sound from memory if it not used after 5 seconds. Prevents memory allocation issues.
usertrack = Toggles the ability to play custom tracks over channel 1 of the radio. These tracks are loaded from the "SFX\Radio\UserTracks\" directory. Press "1" when the radio is selected to change track.

autosave = Automatically saves the game every 2 minutes. Press "%s" to cancel auto save.
autosave.note = This option only works with "Save anywhere" save type.
txtshadow = Shows a shadow effect for all texts.
fps = Displays the frames per second counter at the top left-hand corner.
frame = Limits the frame rate that the game can run at to a desired value.
frame.note = Usually, 60 FPS or higher is preferred. If you are noticing excessive stuttering at this setting, try lowering it to make your framerate more consistent.
bar = Makes the bars moving smoother.
startvideo = "Startup videos" plays startup videos while opening the game.
