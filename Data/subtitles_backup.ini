[SFX\Radio\Chatter1.ogg]
0.45=Doctor Maynard, please report in at Gate B.
6.7=Um, Doctor Maynard, do you copy?
9.67=This is Agent Ulgrin, sir. I'm afraid Doctor Maynard is still inside the facility.
15.2=Oh, um, have you any idea of his location or if he's still alive?
20.1=Negative, sir. All we know is that he hasn't made it out yet.
24.65=Copy that. Um, this place is such a God damn maze and he's been working here only for a week. So, it's no wonder he couldn't find his way out. I hope he's still hanging in there.
35.6=I guess we'll find out when the Mobile Task Force goes in.

[SFX\Radio\Chatter2.ogg]
0.35=This is Security Chief Franklin. Doctor Harp, do you copy?
6.96=This is Doctor Harp, I'm in the middle of something here so please be quick.
11.69=I believe that the incident report of 106's breach this morning is still on your computer.
18.5=That's right. Um, feel free to read it if you can reach my office.
23.45=We could just read the file through the facility Intranet. We'll need your personal access code to do that, of course.
30.9=Oh yeah well, um, sounds good! Um, as I've said I'm pretty busy now, we're giving the Mobile Task Force a little brief before sending them in. I'll get there and give you the code when we're done. Shouldn't take longer than fifteen minutes.
44.1=I'm sorry, but we need that file immediately! I understand it's against security protocol. But considering the circumstances, couldn't you just give me the code through the radio? At this point, I don't think the situation could become any worse, no matter who's listening to us right now.
62.8=Well, yeah I- I think you're right. The code is 7-8-1-6.
69.78=Copy that.

[SFX\Radio\Chatter3.ogg]
0.4=Um, someone seems to have disabled the remote door control system.

[SFX\Radio\Chatter4.ogg]

3.4=Um, seems to be some Class-D.
7.85=Heh, I bet you fifty bucks says he won't make it in another five minutes.

[SFX\Radio\Franklin1.ogg]
0.65=Mobile Task Force unit Nine-Tailed Fox is being prepped for entry. Hang in there! This will all be over soon.

[SFX\Radio\Franklin2.ogg]
0.6=To everyone still inside the facility, stay in the evacuation shelters. Do not try to make it to the exits, no matter how close they are. The shelters are your best chance of making it through this.

[SFX\Radio\Franklin3.ogg]
0.635=To everyone still hearing this, reality-bending events are common during containment breaches of this magnitude. Do not trust your senses! Do not trust anyone or anything.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio2.ogg]
3.2=A reminder, in the event of an XK-Class end-of-the-world scenario, don't panic. It won't help.
11.3=Nothing at all will help.
13.5=However, panicking will help probably the least.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio3.ogg]
2.9=Report all suspect behavior to your supervisors immediately. If you haven't noticed any unusual activity recently, you're not looking hard enough. A threat to security can originate from anywhere, and no one is above suspicion. Not even you.
18.92=Stay paranoid. Stay vigilant.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio4.ogg]
3.5=Should you hear a different voice announcing for SCP foundation on-site radio, disregard it entirely. He is not a foundation employee. He is trying to trick you and cannot be trusted. Any advice he gives can only inevitably lead to destruction, death, and utter chaos. You are immeasurably better off listening to me.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio5.ogg]
3.8=In the extremely unlikely event of a catastrophic power failure and subsequent facility-wide containment breach, just remember the crisis ABCs. A for armaments. B for blinking, come the lack of. And C for cardiovascular fortitude. As they say, shoot, stare, and sprint! Or, feed the oncoming monster one of your friends.
29.3=Stay alive. Stay vigilant.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio6.ogg]
10.10=<glitch=true>Every single thing he says is a lie.

29.65=<glitch=true>I can get you out of this.
33.75=<glitch=true>I can get you away from all of this.
40.40=<glitch=true>Just listen to me.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio7.ogg]
2.6=Don't forget, Wednesday is pizza day! So head on down to the cafeteria and grab yourself a hot slice! 
11.7=(The SCP Foundation holds no liability for any injuries or illnesses sustained or contracted through the attendance of pizza day.)

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio8.ogg]
3.2=When dining in the facility cafeteria, always remember to check your rations for the deadly seven. Strychnine, Arsenic Trioxide, Nitrobenzene, Mercury, Epichlorohydrin, Acetone Thiosemicarbazone, and spiders. Stay healthy! Stay vigilant.
